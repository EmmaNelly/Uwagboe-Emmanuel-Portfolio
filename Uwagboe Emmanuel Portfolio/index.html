          but not limited to HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Git and Netlify. I
          know everything needed to make a website function, efficiently. I
          didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript

          I thrive in collaborative environments and have successfully
          contributed to projects with multidisciplinary teams. Notable
          collaborations include Programming Hero, where effective communication
          and teamwork were paramount to project success. I was involved in
          making a website for the PH Convention. They liked it. And uploaded
          the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
